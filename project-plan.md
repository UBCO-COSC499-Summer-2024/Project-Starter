## Teamwork Planning and Anticipated Hurdles (Completion Plan)
Based on the teamwork icebreaker survey, talk about the different types of work involved in a software development project. Start thinking about what you are good at as a way to get to know your teammates better. At the same time, know your limits so you can identify which areas you need to learn more about. These will be different for everyone. But in the end, you all have strengths and you all have areas where you can improve. Think about what those are, and think about how you can contribute to the team project. Nobody is expected to know everything, and you will be expected to learn (just some things, not everything).
Use the table below to help line up everyone’s strengths and areas of improvement together. The table should give the reader some context and explanation about the values in your table.

For **experience** provide a description of a previous project that would be similar to the technical difficulty of this project’s proposal.  None, if nothing
For **good At**, list of skills relevant to the project that you think you are good at and can contribute to the project.  These could be soft skills, such as communication, planning, project management, and presentation.  Consider different aspects: design, coding, testing, and documentation. It is not just about the code.  You can be good at multiple things. List them all! It doesn’t mean you have to do it all.  Don’t ever leave this blank! Everyone is good at something!

|  Category  | Colton Palfrey | Jerry Fan | Aayush Chaudhary | Chinmay Arvind | Omar Hemed | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|  **Experience**  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  **Good At**  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  **Expect to learn**  | Don’t ever leave this blank! We are all learning.  | Understanding your limits is important. Where do you expect you will need help? | It may not be technical skills. You may be a good coder but never worked with people in a team. Maybe you built a web- site but not used a framework. | It may also be a theoretical concept you already learned but never applied in practice. | Think about different project aspects: design, data security, web security, IDE tools, inte- gration testing, CICD, etc. There will be something. | Don’t ever leave this blank! We are all learning. | 

Use this opportunity to discuss with your team who **may** do what in the project. Make use of everyone’s skill set and discuss each person’s role and responsibilities by considering how everyone will contribute.  Remember to identify project work (some examples are listed below at the top of the table) and course deliverables (the bottom half of the table). You might want to change the rows depending on what suits your project and team.  Understand that no one person will own a single task.  Recall that this is just an incomplete example.  Please explain how things are assigned in the caption below the table, or put the explanation into a separate paragraph so the reader understands why things are done this way and how to interpret your table.
