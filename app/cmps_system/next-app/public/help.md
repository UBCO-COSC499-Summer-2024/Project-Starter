## FAQ

### How can instructors use the system to get an overview of their assignments and status?

Instructors can log in with their user ID and password. They can retrieve forgotten passwords via email. Once logged in, they can view their own data, including course and service assignments, but cannot edit their profiles. Visualizations are available to compare their data against department benchmarks. They can also see service and course assignments for the entire department, with filtering options by subject or area.

### How can department heads get an overview of overall department performance?

Department heads can log in and use the **Evaluations Page** to access comprehensive visualizations. These visualizations allow them to compare evaluation results across the department, view data over time, and aggregate information as averages, minimums, and maximums. Additionally, the Dashboard widget displays the total service hours logged by the department versus the benchmark for the current month, helping them monitor departmental performance at a glance.

### How can department staff efficiently add or edit data related to instructors, courses, TAs, and assignments?

Department staff can use the user interface to enter service assignments and can import course and TA assignments via CSV files. The system supports re-importing data for the same year and detecting changes with user approval. Course performance and SEI data can also be imported through CSV files. Staff can record department meetings and attendees quickly, export data into CSV/Excel, and request instructors to provide TA reviews.

### What are the capabilities of system administrators?

System administrators can add, edit, or delete accounts and perform system maintenance. If an account is not active or eligible for login, its data is retained for historical analysis. System administrators may also be department heads or staff.
