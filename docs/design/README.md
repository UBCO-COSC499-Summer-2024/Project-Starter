# Introduction
The Optical Marking Management System (OMMS) is a responsive web application for managing optically marked exams. It automates exam creation, marking, and analysis to reduce instructor workload and ensure consistent assessments.

We are building a system that will allow instructors to upload PDFs of bubble sheets that have been scanned by a printer (or other scanner). The system will scan the bubble sheet with image processing techniques to automatically mark the bubble sheet against an answer key. The system will then automatically store the marks on our web app's database, allowing for students and instructors to see the marked exams (if students are allowed).

The app will then allow for exporting of CSV grade reports for the instructor to upload to a site like Canvas for the grades to be registered.

We are expecting to build features that allow instructors to create and mark exams with as much ease as possible. That means automating as much as possible, allowing for features like duplication of previous exams, and allowing the user to change grades for students should the need arise before they export the grades to Canvas (or a similar site)
