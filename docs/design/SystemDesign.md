# System Design

## Introduction

Start with a brief introduction of **what** you are building, reminding the reader of the high-level usage scenarios (project purpose).   Complete each section with the required components.  Don't forget that you can include [images in your markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#images).  

Start each section with a lead-in, detailing what it is.  Also, do not just have a collection of images.   Each diagram must be explained clearly. **Do not assume that the reader understands the intentions of your designs**.

GradeFalcon is an Optical Mark Recognition System for managing the automatic grading of students' bubble sheets. Teachers will be able to create exams for classes, create the formats for exams, have submitted PDFs accurately marked from the exam's answer key and visualize various class performance metrics. Students will be able to have their submissions returned to them with the correct and incorrect answers highlighted and report if the system has made any error in marking. Administrators will have full privilege over all system data.


## System Architecture Design

Recall the system architecture slides and tell us which architecture pattern you are using and why (it may also be something not in the slides or be a combination). Provide more details about the components you have written, and where these components fit in the overall architecture so we can visualize how you have decomposed your system. Basically, this should all be captured in ONE diagram with the components on them and a few sentences explaining (i) why you chose this architecture and (ii) why the components are where you put them. If you want to just focus on a certain aspect of your system and not show the entire architecture for your system in the diagram, that should be fine as well.

## System Architecture for Optical Marking Management System

### Architecture Pattern: Model-View-Controller (MVC)

#### Reason for Choosing MVC

We chose the MVC architecture for the following reasons:

- **Separation of Concerns:** MVC separates the application into three interconnected components, which allows for efficient division of labor and simplifies maintenance.
- **Testability:** Each component can be tested independently, which improves the overall robustness of the application.
- **Flexibility:** Changes in the user interface can be made without affecting the underlying business logic and data.

### Components and Their Placement

#### Model:

- **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data storage. Some of our entities: Users, Exams, and Results.

#### View:

- **User Interface:** Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React). Provides a responsive and interactive UI for users.
- **Visualization Tools:** Implements charts and graphs for displaying statistical analysis of exam results.

#### Controller:

- **Business Logic:** Developed using Node.js, handling user requests, processing data, and returning the appropriate responses.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Manages user authentication using JWT and uses authorization middleware for access.
- **Error Detection:** Includes logic for detecting wrongly scanned sheets and duplicate/non-present student IDs.

- **OMR Tools Integration:** Incorporates a YOLO-based computer vision model for bubble sheet parsing and grading.

### System Architecture Diagram with RBAC

![System Architecture Design with RBAC](SystemArchitectureRBAC.png "System Architecture Design with RBAC")

### Why Components Are Placed as Shown

- **Model (Database):** Centralized data handling and ensure that all business logic related to data management and error detection is confined to one place, making the system more modular.
- **View (Frontend):** By separating the user interface from the backend, we ensure that any changes to the UI do not affect the underlying business logic. This separation also allows for better scalability and responsiveness.
- **Controller (Backend):** Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, handling all incoming requests, applying necessary business logic, and returning appropriate responses. The controller manages the flow of data and the communication between the frontend and backend.
- **RBAC Integration:** Implementing RBAC directly in the backend enables authentication and authorization based on user roles, simplifying role management.


### Here are alternative System Architectures that were considered:

## Use Case Models

Extending from your requirements, the team will need to develop a set of usage scenarios for each user group documented as properly dressed use cases Â (including diagrams following the UML syntax and descriptions as presented in class). You may also want to include journey lines with some use cases.

## Database Design 

Provide an ER diagram of the entities and relationships you anticipate having in your system (this will most likely change, but you need a starting point). Â In a few sentences, explain why the data is modelled this way and what is the purpose of each table/attribute. Â For this part, you only need to have ONE diagram and an explanation.

!["ER Diagram](er_diagram.jpg "ER Diagram")

### Summary

This database is designed to efficiently manage and store all data associated with creating, marking, and reviewing bubble sheet exams. It not only handles exam-related data but also manages user records and essential information required for the key functionalities of our system.

### How Users Interact with the Database

**Teachers**
- **Create Exams**: Teachers create exams (bubble sheets) and provide the solutions. This data is stored in the `Exam` and `Solution` tables.
- **Upload Submissions**: Teachers upload scanned student submissions, which are saved in the `ScannedExam` table.
- **Mark Exams**: The system automatically marks the exams by comparing student submissions to the provided solutions. The results are stored in the `StudentResults` table.
- **Review and Analyze**: Teachers review the automatically marked exams and view results, generating visualizations of exam performance using data from the `Exam` table.

**Students**
- **View Results**: Students log in to view their marked exams, with the relevant data fetched from the `StudentResults` table.
- **Provide Feedback**: Students can report any perceived errors in their results, which are recorded for further review.

**Admins**
- **Manage Users**: Admins handle user registrations and permissions, with information stored and managed in the `Teacher`, `Student`, and `Admin` tables.


## Data Flow Diagram (Level 0/Level 1)

The team is required to create comprehensive Level 0 and Level 1 Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to visually represent the systemâs data flow, including key processes, data stores, and data movements. Â The deliverables will include a high-level context diagram, a detailed Level 1 DFD, and supporting documentation to facilitate the understanding of data movement within the system. Â  Remember that within a L1 DFD, the same general level of abstraction should apply to all processes (review 310 notes for guidance)

![Level 0 DFD](Level0dfd.jpeg "Level 0 DFD")
![Level 1 DFD](Level1dfd.jpeg "Level 1 DFD")

## User Interface (UI) Design

The team is required to put forward a series of UI mock-ups that will be used as starting points for the design of the system Â  They can be minimal but the team will need to Â have at least made some choices about the interaction flow of the application. Â You should consider the different major aspects of user interactions and develop UI mockups for those (think about the different features/use cases and what pages are needed; you will have a number most likely). Â Additionally, create a diagram to explain the navigation flow for the MVP Â prototype (and any alternate flows). Â When considering your UI, think about usability, accessibility, desktop and mobile uses. Â As a team, you will need to discuss design choices for the system.
