# Daily Development Log

## Date: 2024-05-30

### Notes
Here is an explanation of the requirements:
 
- Department Head/Manager will use the system to track certain instructor activities including: service roles and hours, course assignments and performance.
- The service roles include things like being Undergraduate Advisor, Graduate Advisor, member on committees, etc. Track the expected hours per month (but we do not need to have the instructors actually log their time). Be able to store description of each service role.
- Another data set to track is course assignments including number of students, student survey data, etc.
- For both data sets, Department Head should be able to see data on individual instructors and for the department overall including charts/visualizations.
- Instructors will only use the system to see their current service hours, course assignments, and have visibility on service and course assignments for the department.
- It is not expected that instructors will be able to edit the data directly.
- If there are incentives/visualizations that encourage more effort, then that is great, but it is not the most critical requirement of the system.
